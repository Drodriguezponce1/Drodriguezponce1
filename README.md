## Hi there 🌌

**`Aspiring Software Engineer, forging a path from the Dark Side in the Star Wars galaxy....`**

On a more serious note, my name is Daniel J. Rodriguez-Ponce, and I am a Software Engineer aspiring to specialize in Back-End Development. I am eager to master all the intricacies of software engineering while honing my expertise. My current focus is on leveraging skills in Java, Python, and SQL to expand my knowledge and explore other programming languages. This repository serves as a chronicle of my journey — from learning Python, working on side projects, and eventually diving into advanced technologies like AI

### 🙋‍♂️ ⁉️ So, What's next?         

On my journey through the galaxy, I aim to explore and learn new skills along the way:
    * Delve into Prompt Engineering, AI agents, and leverage open-source resources like CrewAI.
    * Master data structures and algorithms by advancing through LeetCode challenges.
    * Embark on a path to build projects centered around APIs and their integration.
